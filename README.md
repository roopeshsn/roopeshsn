> Fact that made me flabbergasted: During the reign of Raja Raja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Bay of Bengal was referred to as "Chola Lake". Their unmatched maritime dominance and extensive trade networks made the vast sea feel like a lake! There are even records of the Cholas transporting war elephants across the sea on their mighty ships.
